WORD LIST ADDON
=================
Create a directory on your server called wordlists.

Upload all the files that came in this zip file to your server in
ASCII to your new wordlists directory.

Open options.js that came with jsWordsearch and change:

var wordlists = 0;

to

var wordlists = 1;

Then upload options.js to your server to the same location as your
old options.js, making sure to overwrite the old one.
